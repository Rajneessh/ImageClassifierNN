# Image Classifier with Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for building an image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The classifier is designed to categorize images into multiple classes (e.g., cats, dogs, fish, humans, birds).

## Contents

- **Data Preparation**: The notebook demonstrates how to load and preprocess image data, including data augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness.
- **Model Architecture**: A simple yet effective CNN architecture is used, with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Training and Validation**: The model is trained on the prepared dataset with real-time data augmentation. The training process includes monitoring validation accuracy and loss to prevent overfitting.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The notebook includes code to visualize training history (accuracy and loss) and to generate a confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis.

## Improving Model Accuracy

Accuracy of the model can be further improved with the following approaches:

1. **Better Quality Data**: Using higher quality images can help the model learn more effectively. Ensuring that the images are clear and well-labeled is crucial.
2. **More Data**: Increasing the amount of training data generally helps the model generalize better. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming can also create more diverse training samples.
3. **Advanced Model Architectures**: Implementing more complex architectures such as deeper CNNs, ResNet, or Inception networks can capture more intricate patterns in the data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.) can lead to better performance.
5. **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models on large datasets (such as ImageNet) and fine-tuning them on your specific dataset can significantly boost accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Mount Google Drive**: Ensure that your Google Drive is mounted to access the dataset.
